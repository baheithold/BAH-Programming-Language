## Lexical Analysis
Lexical analysis is the first stage of implementing a programming language. Lexical analysis is the process of identifying tokens in a file of characters. The analyzer is also tasked with categorizing those tokens as to they represent. This subsystem is made up of four modules: `types`, `lexeme`, `lexer`, and `scanner`.
