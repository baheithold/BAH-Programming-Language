# BAH Programming Language
This is the `Barely Acceptable and Hideous programming language`. The BAH programming language is a dynamically typed, imperative programming language with similarities to C and JavaScript.

## Todo
* [x] Grammar
* [x] Lexeme Tokens
* [x] Lexer
* [ ] Recognizer
* [ ] Parser
* [ ] Environments
* [ ] Pretty Printing
* [ ] Evaluator
* [ ] Built-in Functions
    * [ ] Type Coercion
    * [ ] print
    * [ ] println

## Ideas
* Host Language: C
* Source File Extension: .bah
* C/C++ like syntax
* Interpreter
* Object Orientated
    * Inheritance
* Dynamically Typed
* Functional
* Programmer-controlled delayed execution (Lazy Execution)
* Parallel Programming Support
    * Multi-threading
* Includes (import)
* ID's can have symbols
* Function Definition
    * If no parameter list is set, the keyword "void" must be used (Syntax Error if neither is used)
* Arrays with O(1) access time
* Associative Arrays (Hash Tables)
* conditionals
* Recursion
* Iteration
    * for
    * foreach (maybe??)
    * while
    * do-while (maybe??)
* Convenient means to access command line arguments
* Convenient means to print to the console and to a file
* Anonymous Functions
* Functions as first-class objects (functions can be manipulated)
* Ternary Operators
