# BAH Programming Language
This is the Barely Acceptable and Hideous programming language. The BAH programming language is a dynamically typed, imperative programming language with similarities to C and Javascript.

### Todo
* [ ] Grammar
* [ ] Types
* [ ] Lexer
* [ ] Recognizer
* [ ] Parser
* [ ] Environments
* [ ] Pretty Printing
* [ ] Evaluator
* [ ] Built-in Functions
    * [ ] Type Coercion
    * [ ] print
    * [ ] println

### Ideas
* Host Language: C
* C/C++ like syntax
* Interpretter
* Compiler
* Object Orientated
    * Inheritance
* Functional
* Dynamically Typed
* Garbage Collection (Controlled with interpretter options)
    * Start with Automatic Garbage Collection, Implement programmer control later
    * Programmer Managed
    * Auto
* Programmer-controlled delayed execution
* Parallel Programming Support
    * Multi-threading
* Includes
* Extension: .bah
* ID's can have symbols
* Function Definition
    * If no parameter list is preset, the keyword "void" must be used
* Built-in Functions
    * type coercion functions
    * print and println
* Arrays with O(1) access time
* Associative Arrays (Hash Tables)
* conditionals
* Recursion
* Iteration
    * for
    * while
    * do-while (maybe??)
* Convenient means to access command line arguments
* Convenient means to print to the console and to a file
* Anonymous Functions
* Functions as first-class objects (functions can be manipulated)
* Ternary Operators
